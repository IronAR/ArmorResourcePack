# ArmorResourcePack
Add-on for the PirateCraft reosurce pack, for crews to have CIT custom armour design per crew.
Official pack for Gameplay chagnes & event items/weapons is https://github.com/piratecraft/Resourcepack

This can not be an auto-downlaodable pack in-game, as adding these to the main pack would confuse and conflict with event items that are rare/aquired/haveabiltiies, this pack is is simply for crews to differentiate during PvP battles by wearing their Crews armour!
This would be extreamly confusing to new players seeing people in custom armour, they would think its got special abilities! 

## Rules for this pack
1) One design & color of armour per crew, you cant have multiple designs and colors per crew.
- To differentiate between players in a crew you can have customised alternative version of your crew armour in the form of a differnt colored band around an arm/shoulder pad colors, but the Core design & color of the armour needs to be consistent for all crew members.
2) The name of the armour needs to be your crew tag
3) This pack is primarily just for armour nothing else

## Credit
You HAVE to give credit for where you have taken items from, for example if you use [Doku Stash](https://dokucraft.co.uk/stash/?search=armor+!item&sc=shortcut) you would need to write under this credit section what you used for what crew.
